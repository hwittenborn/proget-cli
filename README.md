# ProGet CLI
This is `pg`, a CLI interface for [ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget) instances.
> *This tool is unofficial, and isn't supported by Inedo.*

## Installation
Available installation options are listed below. If you'd added `pg` to somewhere and would like the instructions listed, feel free to submit a PR!

### MPR
`pg` is available on the [MPR](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/pg). First make sure you have [makedeb](https://docs.makedeb.org/installing) set up, and then run the following:

```sh
git clone 'https://mpr.makedeb.org/pg'
cd pg/
makedeb -si
```

## Usage
*`pg` is currently in early alpha, and stability/quality is not guaranteed. Any loss is at your own risk.*

Very few commands have been implemented so far - if there's any in particular you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue about it!

To see currently available commands, just run `pg --help` after installation.
